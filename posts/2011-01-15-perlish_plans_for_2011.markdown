Besides the [Music Hack Day in Cannes](http://cannes.musichackday.org/), there
are some events I will focus on in 2011:

* The [Italian Perl workshop](http://www.perl.it/workshop).  This year, for a
  change, we will be in Turin. The conference will be held on September 8-9,
  with my [Introductory Perl Class](http://www.stefanorodighiero.net/perl101/)
  the day before. I'm linking the material for last year's class, but I have
  slightly I would like to go faster on basic syntax -- spending a reasonable
  amount of time dispelling doubts about data structures, which proved to be
  useful -- and to present [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose) as "the way
  you should do OOP in Perl", probably mentioning the old way as historical
  curiosity.

* In the middle of August there will be [YAPC::Europe](http://yapceurope.lv/),
  in Riga. It may seem odd to say that in January, but I'm looking forward for
  a climatic detour from the hot days we're likely to have in Spain. And it
  will be great to meet friends and Perl hackers, as usual.

* For the past two years I missed the [London Perl
  Workshop](http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2010/). I think its single day
  model works very well and should be copied more avidly. And I love to spend
  time in London.
