<p>Besides the <a href="http://cannes.musichackday.org/">Music Hack Day in Cannes</a>, there are some events I will focus on in 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.perl.it/workshop">Italian Perl Workshop</a>. This year, for a change, we will be in Turin. The conference will be held on September 8-9, with my <a href="http://www.stefanorodighiero.net/perl101/">Introductory Perl Class</a> the day before. I'm linking the material for last year's class, but I have slightly different ideas for the incoming version.<br />
I would like to go faster on basic syntax  spending a reasonable amount of time dispelling doubts about data structures, which proved to be useful  and to present <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/Moose-1.21/lib/Moose.pm">Moose</a> as "the way you should do OOP in Perl", probably mentioning the old way as historical curiosity.</li>
<li>In the middle of August there will be <a href="http://yapceurope.lv/">YAPC::Europe</a>, in Riga. It may seem odd to say that in January, but I'm looking forward for a climatic detour from the hot days we're likely to have in Spain. And it will be great to meet friends and Perl hackers, as usual.</li>
<li>For the past two years I missed the <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2010/">London Perl Workshop</a>. I think its single day model works very well and should be copied more avidly. And I love to spend time in London.</li>
</ul>
