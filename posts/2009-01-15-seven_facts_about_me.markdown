title: Seven facts about me
---

<a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/">gmax</a> challenged me to participate in this game. The rules:
<ul>
	<li>Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.</li>
	<li>Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some weird.</li>
	<li>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.</li>
	<li>Let them know theyÂ’ve been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter.</li>
</ul>
And here some facts about me:
<ul>
	<li>I was blessed by the opportunity of writing an <a href="http://www.stefanorodighiero.net/pocketperl/">introductory book about Perl</a>, published in Italy by Apogeo. I wrote most of it by night, in two continents and four countries (or during flights).</li>
	<li>I lived in Barcelona since April 2008. I speak Italian and English, and I'm learning Spanish (now I can express things just to some extent). Other languages I've been exposed to are French and Portuguese. In April 2012 I moved to Bologna (so, I'm back in Italy)</li>
	<li>I work as a programmer, and that's more or less what I've always done. I have some experience as a teacher, too.</li>
	<li>I'm left-handed.</li>
	<li>I studied classical guitar for quite a long time. Shame on me for not keeping study.</li>
	<li>I love to read. My reading pace and favourite genres vary a lot, but giving me a book is usually a simple way to make me happy.</li>
	<li>While everyone calls me Stefano (and <a href="http://twitter.com/larsen">larsen</a> on the net, usually), my parents, my sister and my relatives call me Lorenzo. That's due to some family facts it's boring to explain here.</li>
</ul>
I don't believe interrupting this kind of "memes" could cause damage, severe injury or death, therefore I won't tag anyone specifically. Everyone among my followers in Twitter can consider himself tagged.
