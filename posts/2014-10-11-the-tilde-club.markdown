Intrigued, I rushed to the
[article](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf),
and read it with a mixture of confusion (*"What? This is definitely not
a new idea!"*) and dazzlement.

Basically, [Paul Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/) created what could now
be called a *community platform*, using possibly the oldest tool we
know: a Unix server (I think Paul is using GNU/Linux on AWS) properly
configured to serve what's in users' ``public_html/`` directories.

[Tilde.club](http://tilde.club/) is as simple as that, yet Paul
received lots of "subscription" requests already: after the first
batch of a few hundreds users, he had to put them in a waiting list.

I'd be curious to know the demographics of Tilde.club's userbase: are
they old fashioned hackers, immersed in a revival of the way (part of)
Internet worked back in the days? Young people, discovering that that
ancient way of aggregating works and is fun? Or, perhaps, is the
entire operation a parody?

Nowadays one person's emanations on the Net are scattered across
different channels: say Facebook for personal things, Goodreads for
what you read, Instagram for what you saw, Twitter for news and
arguing with strangers, and so on. Usually, each emanation is just one
facet of a personality. I think these facets have something in common
with what
[Douglas Coupland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland)
called *"isotopes of you"*:

> Identity. I go by the Tootsie theory: that if you concoct a
> convincing on-line meta-personality on the Net, then that
> personality really IS you. With so few things around nowadays to
> loan a person identity, the palette of identities you create for
> yourself in the vacuum of the Net - your menu of alternative
> "you's" - actually IS you. Or an isotope of you. Or a photocopy of
> you.

Whereas the services I mentioned leave you staring at the infamous
blank page (I mean a blank textarea), a service like Tilde leave you
in front of a void you have to structure and replenish, choosing your
own way to represent yourself. Maybe this is what attracts people to
Tilde.
