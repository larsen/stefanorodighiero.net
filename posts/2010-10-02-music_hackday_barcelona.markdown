Today I attended the first half of the [Music Hackday](http://bcn.musichackday.org/), in Barcelona. Here some pictures:

I should certainly spend many more words about this great event, but in short:

* Congrats to the orgas for the smooth and enjoyable day: plenty of space to
hack, nice location, and the internet connection was just working

* There's a lot of interesting APIs and products outside to explore, more than
  I expected: besides the big and very-well-known players like Last.fm, I
  discovered
  [MuseScore](http://wiki.musichackday.org/index.php?title=MuseScore),
  [The EchoNest](http://wiki.musichackday.org/index.php?title=The_Echo_Nest) and
  [Canoris](http://wiki.musichackday.org/index.php?title=Canoris)
  just to mention a few.

* I never tried this _un_conference formula before, but I think I'll look for
  more: even if I didn't hack very much (just polished some bits of my
  [MusixMatch API](http://developer.musixmatch.com/) [Perl
  client](http://github.com/larsen/Net-MusixMatch)), I really enjoyed the
  general atmosphere, and I can't wait to see what the other attendees will
  present tomorrow.
