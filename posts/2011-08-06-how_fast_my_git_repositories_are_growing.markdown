title: How fast my git repositories are growing?
---

I wrote a very small utility to gather LOC counts from a git repository. Called
gitsloc, it's based on [Cloc](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/), with some extra
goodness provided by
[Sysadm::Install](http://search.cpan.org/~mschilli/Sysadm-Install/) (a rather
inaptly named module, if you ask to me, but full of useful gems).

I guess it could actually have some uses, who knows?, but I wrote it mostly
because I wanted to see how fast repos are growing, and
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is the obvious tool to tinker with the results.

I'm less than a beginner with R, and I have to admit plotting data from a
multi-column CSV file is less straitghforward than I expected: I had to
useÂ ``xyplot`` from the [lattice
package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html), like this:

``` R
xyplot(
  Perl + Bourne.Shell ~ 1:nrow(sloc),
  data = sloc,
  type = 'a',
  auto.key = list( space = "top", lines = TRUE, points = FALSE)
)
```

Here the result, with data provided analysing the [Dancer](http://www.perldancer.org/) github repository (branch devel).
