Yay! The laptop I recently bought for a ridiculously low price is
eventually working like I want.

First its characteristics:

----------- ---------------------------------------------
**CPU**                          Intel Pentium M (Dothan)
**RAM**                                             512MB
**HDD**                                    40GB 2.5" PATA
**Display**            12.1" TFT with 1024x768 resolution
----------- ---------------------------------------------

It is a
[IBM Thinkpad X32](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X32). A good
news is it sports one of the best keyboards one can find on a laptop
(and I was lucky enough to find the GB layout).  I found it at an
electronic fair I recently visited, and grabbed it without much
thinking from the pile (literally) where it layed together with some
of its twins.

I think it's remarkable that such an old piece of hardware can be a
perfectly usable machine (at least for the way I'm used to work). All
it takes is some attention to the software one chooses to install:

* Linux, obvious choice to revive old hardware (in this case, I had to
  recur to a non-PAE kernel due to the particular CPU architecture)
* [i3](http://i3wm.org/), a lightweight tiling window manager
* Emacs 24.3, where I'm going to spend much of my time
  ([w3m](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m) is a decent
  surrogate of a proper graphical browser for reading documentation)
* I'm even running Hakyll locally to prepare this post
