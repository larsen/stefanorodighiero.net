> Anyone who works with computers learns to fear their capacity to
> forget. Like so many things with computers, memory is strictly
> binary. There is either perfect recall or total oblivion, with nothing
> in between. It doesn't matter how important or trivial the information
> is. The computer can forget anything in an instant. If it remembers,
> it remembers for keeps.

> [...]

> Our lives have become split between two worlds with two very different
> norms around memory.

> [...]

> The online world is very different. Online, everything is recorded by
> default, and you may not know where or by whom. If you've ever
> wondered why Facebook is such a joyless place, even though we've
> theoretically surrounded ourselves with friends and loved ones, it's
> because of this need to constantly be wearing our public
> face. Facebook is about as much fun as a zoning board hearing.
