title: Music Hack Day London 2011
---

Last weekend, I went to London to participate in the 
[Music Hack Day](http://london.musichackday.org/2011/).

This particular hackathon is growing with a very fast rhythm. Consider what
follows, for example: my very first MHD was [Barcelona in October
2010](http://bcn.musichackday.org/2010/), and from that moment I had the
opportunity to partecipate in three other editions ([New
York](http://nyc.musichackday.org/), [San
Francisco](http://sf.musichackday.org/2011/), and another time in
[Barcelona](http://bcn.musichackday.org/2011/)) and to be among the public
during the [Cannes' edition](http://cannes.musichackday.org/2011/).  That, and
I also managed to skip another twos. After less than three years since the
entire initiative started, it has demonstrated a relentless pace in proposing
new events and building a community of music hackers (more on that later).

## Spotify App Store, and MXM's hack

I think one of the main themes during this MHD was the recently announced
[Spotify App
Store](http://www.spotify.com/se/blog/archives/2011/11/30/say-hello-to-spotify-apps/).
Most appropriately, a group of Spotify developers was present at the
conference, which proved to be an inestimable source of help and encouragement
during the 24H sprint.

Despite some minor glitches and random problems with the development
environment, I have to say that writing software that has to be deployed into
the Spotify client is a pleasure. It all boils down to write one or more web
pages, using Javascript to make it live, via Spotify's API and maybe another
third party service to do something interesting.

In fact – after all, [I'm a musixmatcher](http://www.musixmatch.com/) – we
spent the weekend working on a lyrics app. I think the aim of such a project is
obvious, anyway here a screenshot.

## Next?

I'm not sure where next MHD will be. There will be a new "proof of concept"
during [Midem](http://www.midem.com/) early in 2012, and I heard about another
full-fledged edition in Amsterdam soon. I have the feeling, also, that [Dave
Haynes](http://davehaynes.me), our über-organizer, is almost flooded with
cities offering to host next MHDs. That's good news.

I think the majority of the attendants are employed in companies operating in
the digital music ecosystem, but I also met many "solo" developers simply
attracted by the coolness of the event. More importantly, I can't help but
seeing people helping each other and collaborating even if they're not
coworkers or members of the same masterplan to conquer the music industry. In
other words, a true community is growing.

I'm not sure what's the best way to keep nourishing this community: certainly
there's no shortage of opportunities to meet, but I think more can be done on
the online part. Food for thought.
