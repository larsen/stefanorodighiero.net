## Essays/Computer science/$work stuff

* [Programming Pig](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449302645)
* [Hadoop The definitive guid](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449302645)
* [Cassandra: The definitive guide](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449390412)
* [Data Analysis with Open Source Tools](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596802358)

In 2011 I started my adventures in the perilous lands of bigdata, so I've begun
harvesting literature on the subject. Extremely interesting and relatively
young field. I have an almost finished review of "Data Analysis with Open
Source Tools" which I hope to publish soon.

* [The Passionate Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356344)
* [Longitudine](http://www.amazon.com/dp/8817112909)

## Novels

* [Generation A](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439157022)
* [Microserfs](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0007179812)

My first encounter with [Douglas
Coupland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland). I particularly liked
Microserfs, that somehow seemed to be speaking directly to me. Perhaps not for
everybody.

* [A game of Thrones](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553103547)
* [A clash of Kings](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553108034)
* [A storm of Swords](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0006479901)

Five minutes after [Games of
Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)) s01e01 I
realized I couldn't wait an entire week to know the rest of the story. Still
entertaining, after ~3000 pages and already in the fourth book.

* [REAMDE](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061977969)

I'm a hardcore [Neal Stephenson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)
fan. I also have Anathem in my stack, but I decided to read Reamde first,
because it seemed less dense. It was, and also more fast-paced than usual.

* [La sombra del viento](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307472590)
* [La donna della domenica](http://www.amazon.com/dp/8804499079)
* [Solomon Gursky è stato qui](http://www.amazon.com/dp/8845921794)
