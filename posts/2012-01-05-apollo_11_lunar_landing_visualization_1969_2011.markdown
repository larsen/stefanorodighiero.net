> The Apollo 11 visualization draws together social and technical data from the
> [Apollo 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11) 1969 moon
> landing in a dynamic 2D graphic. The horizontal axis is an interactive
> timeline. The vertical axis is divided into several sections, each
> corresponding to a data [...] Specific events are labeled, such as computer
> program changes and program alarms. During a real-time playback, the white line
> moves across the horizontal axis as audio plays, and the crew's specific
> utterances are spelled out to the right. In sync with the human dialog, the AGC
> and DSKY display values and modes. In these dynamics, one can trace the trading
> of workload and authority during the critical final phases of landing, and how
> that workload was offloaded from the LEM to Houston in response to the program
> alarms.
