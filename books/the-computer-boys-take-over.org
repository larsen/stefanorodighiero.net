* 1. Introduction: Computer Revolutionaries

*** Among  the history of computing, histories of hw and sw can be treated as separate things

**** Hardware history is characterized by "regular and remarkable progress"

**** While for software "tension, conflict, failure, ..." is constant

**** There's is no Moore's Law for software technology

**** But the problem was not always (or not only) that software did not work, but that it had undesiderable effects for the organizations using it

*** With software computer became _tools to manage_, instead of _tools to be managed_

**** Computer specialists are "agents of change"

*** History of computer programming

**** or, more aptly, history of humans building software

**** "that this work would turn out to be difficult and require radically innovative thinking was completely unanticipated"

**** coding was considered a low, "static" occupation; something that could be done by low-level worker

***** mechanical translation

***** rote transcription

**** Maurice Wilkes: "And it was with somewhat of a shock that I realized that for the rest of my life I was going to spend a good deal of my time finding mistakes that I had made in my programs"

* 2. The Black Art of Programming
