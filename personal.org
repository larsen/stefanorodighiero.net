Here some facts about me:

- I was blessed by the opportunity of writing an [introductory book
  about Perl](/pocketperl/), published in Italy by Apogeo. I wrote
  most of it by night, in two continents and four countries (or during
  flights).

- I lived in Barcelona since April 2008. I speak Italian and English,
  and I'm learning Spanish (now I can express things just to some
  extent). Other languages I've been exposed to are French and
  Portuguese. In April 2012 I moved to Bologna (so, I'm back in Italy)

- I work as a programmer, and that's more or less what I've always
  done. I have some experience as a teacher, too.

- I'm left-handed.

- I studied classical guitar for quite a long time. Shame on me for
  not keeping study.

- I love to read. My reading pace and favourite genres vary a lot, but
  giving me a book is usually a simple way to make me happy.

- While everyone calls me Stefano (and
  [larsen](http://twitter.com/larsen) on the net, usually), my
  parents, my sister and my relatives call me Lorenzo.  That's due to
  some family facts it's boring to explain here.
