* Software I'm looking for

Here some software I'm looking for. If you happen to have something to suggest
please contact me!

** <2015-10-02 Fri> Something to gather, organize and maintain a collection of scientific papers
*** My /non-workflow/ is currently like:
- Download a paper (PFD, Postscript, …); most of time I'm willing to
  read it later
- When I finally have time to read it, I discover I lost the file
  - Perhaps because usually the filename has little to do with its
    content?
- Download the paper again
  - It's possible I'll decide to place the file somewhere else
  - I currently have many directories that were created as THE place
    where I should collect papers
- Read and annotate it (I'm currently using Preview.app for that)

*** I'd like to be able to do more:
- Maintain a list of papers I downloaded, with metadata
- The archive should be easily searchable
- Be able to add my own metadata, like tags
- I want to store the files on the filesystem, but with some sort of
  infrastructure layer upon it to access them

*** Things I'd rather not use:
- Anything "in the cloud"
- Anything web based (but I'm non strict about that)
- Anything that forces me to manipulate the original file (like,
  storing it in blobs/virtual-fs thus masking it in the native FS)

*** Things I'm considering                                            :wip:

| Product  | Metadata | Search | FS based | In the cloud | Web based | Price   |
| [[http://www.papersapp.com/][Papers]]   | ✓        | ✓      | ✓        |              | -[fn:1]         | € 71.98 |
| [[https://www.mendeley.com][Mendeley]] |          |        |          |              |           |         |

** <2015-10-02 Fri> Something cross platform that allows PDF reading and annotating

* Software I use
This is a collection of pointers to software I use regularly and that
I find useful.

I marked with a tag software that is only available on the specific
platform I'm currently using (Mac OS X) thus, by this fact itself,
programs I ought to replace with something less restrictive.

** Emacs
I use Emacs for code, notes, agenda, part of this site, and basically
for all my text editing tasks. I'm currently using the build available
from [[http://emacsformacosx.com/][emacsformacosx.com]].

- [[https://github.com/larsen/emacs-configuration][My configuration]]. This repository is normally a couple of iterations
  behind what I actually use
- [[http://stefanorodighiero.net/tags/emacs.html][Articles tagged /emacs/]]. I occasionally write about how I use Emacs,
  when I think one particular application might be of interest for
  other people.
- Main packages I use:
  - [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
  - [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]]
  - [[http://magit.vc/][magit]]
  - [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Yasnippet][yasnippet]]
  - [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]]

** Vim
Before switching to Emacs I was a heavy Vim users. I still appreciate
it and it's my choice when it comes to edit text on remote systems. My
configuration: [[https://github.com/larsen/vim-configuration][https://github.com/larsen/vim-configuration]].

If you want to improve your Vim skill, [[https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim][Practical Vim]] is an excellent
resource.

** [[http://hledger.org/][hledger]]
I started registering *all* my expenses in 2014. hledger is a version
of ledger written in Haskell. Having access at the underlying library
is useful, here an article I wrote about that: [[http://stefanorodighiero.net/tags/ledger.html][Finding duplicate accounts in Hledger journals]].

** [[http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][hakyll]]
Hakyll is a static site generator written in Haskell. It powers the
blog section of my site.

** git

** [[https://www.iterm2.com/][iTerm2]]                                                              :mac:
I am one of those guys that practically live in a shell. After a long
time spent in Terminal.app I found this. It has many additional
features that make life simpler or even nicer (badges, shell integration, …).

** [[https://www.rstudio.com/][RStudio]]
I occasionally use R (in the integrated environment RStudio), mostly
to produce graphics using ggplot2.

** Apple Keynote                                                        :mac:
I occasionally give presentations. I was very fond of [[http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/][MagicPoint]] back
when I was using Linux, but when I switched to Mac OS X I didn't think
the X11 dependancy was convenient. Keynote takes a totally different
approach but is good enough.

** Excel
I love spreadsheets, in general. Or "spreadsheet computing", as I'm
compelled to say. I would like to use something not-proprietary but
Excel is still the best in the category.

** Chrome

** irssi
Always on, on a remote system to which I connect to via ssh. Sometimes I
think about using something like [[http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC][znc]] to integrate IRC in Emacs but I
guess the benefits aren't worth the time.

** VirtualBox

** Spotify

** Calibre
** VLC
* Utilities

** Midnight Commander

** Slate                                                               :mac:
I'd love to use a tiling window manager (i3 or xmonad, probably), but
I'm on a Mac so the best I could find is this utility.

** TunnelBlick                                                         :mac:

* Dismissed

** Nisus Writer                                                        :mac:
I now use different tools for writing, but Nisus Writer is worth
mentioning because it's the product I used, back in 2008, for my
largest writing project so far: [[http://stefanorodighiero.net/pocketperl/][Pocket Perl]].

** Evernote                                                            :mac:

** Quicksilver                                                         :mac:

** Spectacle                                                           :mac:
