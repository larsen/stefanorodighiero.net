<h2>My book</h2>
In 2008 I wrote <a href="pocketperl/">Pocket Perl</a>, an introduction to Perl programming. <a href="http://www.apogeonline.com/">Apogeo</a> published it.

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>

    is a Scheme implementation written in Haskell.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><a href="http://bookflocks.com">Bookflocks</a></strong> is a
    website where I publish (on a weekly basis, or at least I try) interviews
    about books.  Backgrounds and occupations of those whom I have interviewed
    vary a lot: I try to choose people with a scholar-ish profile.
