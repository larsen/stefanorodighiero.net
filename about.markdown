[gmax](http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/) challenged me to participate in this game. The rules:

* Link your original tagger(s), and list these rules on your blog.
* Share seven facts about yourself in the post - some random, some weird.
* Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.
* Let them know they've been tagged by leaving a comment on their blogs and/or Twitter.

And here some facts about me:

* I was blessed by the opportunity of writing an [introductory book about
  Perl](/pocketperl/), published in Italy by
  Apogeo. I wrote most of it by night, in two continents and four countries (or
  during flights).

* I lived in Barcelona since April 2008. I speak Italian and English, and I'm
  learning Spanish (now I can express things just to some extent). Other
  languages I've been exposed to are French and Portuguese. In April 2012 I
  moved to Bologna (so, I'm back in Italy)

* I work as a programmer, and that's more or less what I've always done. I have
  some experience as a teacher, too.

* I'm left-handed.

* I studied classical guitar for quite a long time. Shame on me for not keeping
  study.

* I love to read. My reading pace and favourite genres vary a lot, but giving
  me a book is usually a simple way to make me happy.

* While everyone calls me Stefano (and [larsen](http://twitter.com/larsen) on
  the net, usually), my parents, my sister and my relatives call me Lorenzo.
  That's due to some family facts it's boring to explain here.

I don't believe interrupting this kind of "memes" could cause damage, severe
injury or death, therefore I won't tag anyone specifically. Everyone among my
followers in Twitter can consider himself tagged.
